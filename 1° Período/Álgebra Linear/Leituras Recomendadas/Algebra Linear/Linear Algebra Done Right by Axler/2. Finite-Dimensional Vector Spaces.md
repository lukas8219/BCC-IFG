## 2A Span and Linear Independence
A sum of scalar multiples of the vectors in a list is called a linear combination of the list. 

#### definition: linear combination
A linear combination of a list 𝑣1 , … , 𝑣𝑚 of vectors in 𝑉 is a vector of the form
- 𝑎1𝑣1 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑚𝑣𝑚, 
where 𝑎1 , … , 𝑎𝑚 ∈ 𝐅.

#### definition: span
The set of all linear combinations of a list of vectors 𝑣1 , … , 𝑣𝑚 in 𝑉 is called the span of 𝑣1 , … , 𝑣𝑚, denoted by span(𝑣1 , … , 𝑣𝑚). In other words,

- span(𝑣1 , … , 𝑣𝑚) = {𝑎1𝑣1 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑚𝑣𝑚 ∶ 𝑎1 , … , 𝑎𝑚 ∈ 𝐅}. 

The span of the empty list ( ) is defined to be {0}. The span of a list of vectors in 𝑉 is the smallest subspace of 𝑉 containing all vectors in the list.
