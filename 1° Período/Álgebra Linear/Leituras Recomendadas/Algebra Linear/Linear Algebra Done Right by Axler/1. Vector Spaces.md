Linear algebra is the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional vector spaces. A vector space is a set with operations of addition and scalar multiplication that satisfy natural algebraic properties.

## 1A 𝐑 𝑛 and 𝐂 𝑛
A complex number is an ordered pair (𝑎, 𝑏), where 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐑, but we will write this as 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖. 
 The set of all complex numbers is denoted by:
- 𝐂: 𝐂 = {𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖 ∶ 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐑}. 

Addition and multiplication on 𝐂 are defined by

- (𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖) + (𝑐 + 𝑑𝑖) = (𝑎 + 𝑐) + (𝑏 + 𝑑)𝑖, 
- (𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖)(𝑐 + 𝑑𝑖) = (𝑎𝑐 − 𝑏𝑑) + (𝑎𝑑 + 𝑏𝑐)𝑖; 

here 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑 ∈ 𝐑.

##### Properties of complex arithmetic
commutativity: 
- 𝛼 + 𝛽 = 𝛽 + 𝛼 and 𝛼𝛽 = 𝛽𝛼 for all 𝛼, 𝛽 ∈ 𝐂. 

associativity:
- (𝛼 + 𝛽) + 𝜆 = 𝛼 + (𝛽 + 𝜆) and (𝛼𝛽)𝜆 = 𝛼(𝛽𝜆) for all 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜆 ∈ 𝐂. 

identities:
- 𝜆 + 0 = 𝜆 and 𝜆1 = 𝜆 for all 𝜆 ∈ 𝐂. 

additive inverse:
- For every 𝛼 ∈ 𝐂, there exists a unique 𝛽 ∈ 𝐂 such that 𝛼 + 𝛽 = 0. 

multiplicative inverse:
- For every 𝛼 ∈ 𝐂 with 𝛼 ≠ 0, there exists a unique 𝛽 ∈ 𝐂 such that 𝛼𝛽 = 1. 

distributive property:
- 𝜆(𝛼 + 𝛽) = 𝜆𝛼 + 𝜆𝛽 for all 𝜆, 𝛼, 𝛽 ∈ 𝐂.

### definition: list, length
- Suppose 𝑛 is a nonnegative integer. A list of length 𝑛 is an ordered collection of 𝑛 elements (which might be numbers, other lists, or more abstract objects).
- Two lists are equal if and only if they have the same length and the same elements in the same order.

### definition: 𝐅 𝑛 , coordinate
𝐅 𝑛 is the set of all lists of length 𝑛 of elements of 𝐅: 
- 𝐅 𝑛 = {(𝑥1 , … , 𝑥𝑛 ) ∶ 𝑥𝑘 ∈ 𝐅 for 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝑛}. 
For (𝑥1 , … , 𝑥𝑛 ) ∈ 𝐅𝑛 and 𝑘 ∈ {1, … , 𝑛}, we say that 𝑥𝑘 is the 𝑘 th coordinate of (𝑥1 , … , 𝑥𝑛 ).

## 1B Definition of Vector Space
We will define a vector space to be a set 𝑉 with an addition and a scalar multiplication on 𝑉 that satisfy the properties in the paragraph above.
- An addition on a set 𝑉 is a function that assigns an element 𝑢 + 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 to each pair of elements 𝑢, 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉. 
- A scalar multiplication on a set 𝑉 is a function that assigns an element 𝜆𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 to each 𝜆 ∈ 𝐅 and each 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉.

#### definition: vector space 
A vector space is a set 𝑉 along with an addition on 𝑉 and a scalar multiplication on 𝑉 such that the following properties hold. 
commutativity:
- 𝑢 + 𝑣 = 𝑣 + 𝑢 for all 𝑢, 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉. 

associativity:
- (𝑢 + 𝑣) + 𝑤 = 𝑢 + (𝑣 + 𝑤) and (𝑎𝑏)𝑣 = 𝑎(𝑏𝑣) for all 𝑢, 𝑣, 𝑤 ∈ 𝑉 and for all 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐅. 

additive identity:
- There exists an element 0 ∈ 𝑉 such that 𝑣 + 0 = 𝑣 for all 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉. 

additive inverse 
- For every 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉, there exists 𝑤 ∈ 𝑉 such that 𝑣 + 𝑤 = 0. 

multiplicative identity: 
- 1𝑣 = 𝑣 for all 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉. 

distributive properties 
- 𝑎(𝑢 + 𝑣) = 𝑎𝑢 + 𝑎𝑣 and (𝑎 + 𝑏)𝑣 = 𝑎𝑣 + 𝑏𝑣 for all 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐅 and all 𝑢, 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉.

With the usual operations of addition and scalar multiplication, 𝐅 𝑛 is a vector space over 𝐅, as you should verify The simplest vector space is {0}, which contains only one point.
Elements of a vector space are called vectors or points

### 1C Subspaces
- A subset 𝑈 of 𝑉 is called a subspace of 𝑉 if 𝑈 is also a vector space with the same additive identity, addition, and scalar multiplication as on 𝑉.

#### conditions for a subspace 
A subset 𝑈 of 𝑉 is a subspace of 𝑉 if and only if 𝑈 satisfies the following three conditions. 
additive identity:
- 0 ∈ 𝑈. 

closed under addition: 
- 𝑢, 𝑤 ∈ 𝑈 implies 𝑢 + 𝑤 ∈ 𝑈. 

closed under scalar multiplication:
- 𝑎 ∈ 𝐅 and 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 implies 𝑎𝑢 ∈ 𝑈

The first condition ensures that the additive identity of 𝑉 is in 𝑈. The second condition ensures that addition makes sense on 𝑈. The third condition ensures that scalar multiplication makes sense on 𝑈.

The subspaces of 𝐑 2 are precisely {0}, all lines in 𝐑 2 containing the origin, and 𝐑 2 . The subspaces of 𝐑 3 are precisely {0}, all lines in 𝐑 3 containing the origin, all planes in 𝐑 3 containing the origin, and 𝐑 3 .

####  definition: sum of subspaces 
Suppose 𝑉1 , … , 𝑉𝑚 are subspaces of 𝑉. The sum of 𝑉1 , … , 𝑉𝑚, denoted by 𝑉1 + ⋯ + 𝑉𝑚, is the set of all possible sums of elements of 𝑉1 , … , 𝑉𝑚. More precisely, 𝑉1 + ⋯ + 𝑉𝑚 = {𝑣1 + ⋯ + 𝑣𝑚 ∶ 𝑣1 ∈ 𝑉1 , … , 𝑣𝑚 ∈ 𝑉𝑚}.
